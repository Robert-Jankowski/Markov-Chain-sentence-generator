# Markov-Chain-sentence-generator
A Javascript implementation of Markov Chain used to generate sentences based on text file.
This project uses J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone .txt file.
The file was modified to remove commas, hyphens etc. and separate words, dots, exclamation marks and question marks.
